## Try Now
[Try Now](https://samsonloftin.github.io/rss-reader/)

## What will this test?

1. If there is an array to hold the RSS entries
2. If the RSS entries have URLs
3. If the RSS entries have Names
4. If the menu is hidden by default
5. If the menu is shown once clicked & hides when clicked again
6. If there is atleast one entry loaded in the feed
7. If the feed loads new entries

## Bugs
Chrome has found the API to be unsecured leading to the tests to fail. Until this is fixed, you can load the API anyways by clicking the "Shield w/ the red x" in the address bar while a fix is being made.

## Future Updates
[ ] Have all elements be secure
[ ] Choose new RSS Feed Api
[ ] Design HTML/CSS layout
